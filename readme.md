> The English to Doggo translator

I made this a while ago for fun in Vue with ES6 JavaScript. Later, I made the translator standalone (which is in this repository). If you don't know what this is all about you should read [this](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/doggo) page.
The reason I didn't release it back then because it is still missing alot of translations and the code isn't that clean. If you have suggestions for translations, see the `How to contribute` section.
